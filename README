Implemented:
We believe everything is implemented as specified in the spec

Architexture: 
-Uarray2 with 2x2 blocks containing Pnm_rgb structs which are 
 an integer representation of pixels or words which are binary
 representations of 2x2 blocks of pixels
-module for converting between integer (RGB) and floating-point 
 (YPrPb) representations of pixel
-module for converting between pixel and block of 2x2 pixels
-module for converting between block of 2x2 pixels and uint32_t code words
-module for 4-bit quantized representation of chroma math
-module for discrete cosine coefficients of luminances math
-module for packing and unpacking bit fields
